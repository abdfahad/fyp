  "Early Blight": {
    "Preventive Measures": [
      "Prune or stake plants to improve air circulation and reduce fungal problems.",
      "Make sure to disinfect your pruning shears (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut.",
      "Keep the soil under plants clean and free of garden debris. Add a layer of organic compost to prevent spores from splashing back up onto vegetation.",
      "Drip irrigation and soaker hoses can be used to help keep the foliage dry."
    ],
    "Treatment Options": [
      "For best control, apply copper-based fungicides early, two weeks before disease normally appears or when weather forecasts predict a long period of wet weather. Alternatively, begin treatment when the disease first appears, and repeat every 7-10 days for as long as needed.",
      "Bonide® Garden Dust containing copper and pyrethrins is a safe, one-step control for many insect attacks and fungal problems. Cover both the tops and undersides of leaves with a thin uniform film or dust. Repeat applications every 7-10 days, as needed.",
      "SERENADE Garden is a broad-spectrum, preventative bio-fungicide recommended for the control or suppression of many important plant diseases. Treat prior to foliar disease development or at the first sign of infection. Repeat at 7-day intervals or as needed.",
      "Remove and destroy all garden debris after harvest and practice crop rotation the following year.",
      "Burn or bag infected plant parts. Do NOT compost."

  "Late Blight": {
    "Preventive Measures": [
      "Plant resistant cultivars when available.",
      "Remove volunteers from the garden prior to planting and space plants far enough apart to allow for plenty of air circulation.",
      "Water in the early morning hours, or use soaker hoses, to give plants time to dry out during the day — avoid overhead irrigation.",
      "Destroy all tomato and potato debris after harvest (see Fall Garden Cleanup)."
    ],
    "Treatment Options": [
      "If symptoms are observed, treat plants with one of the following fungicides:",
      "Apply a copper-based fungicide (2 oz/ gallon of water) every 7 days or less, following heavy rain or when the amount of disease is increasing rapidly. If possible, time applications so that at least 12 hours of dry weather follows application.",
      "Organocide® Plant Doctor, a foliar spray, will work through the entire plant to prevent and attack fungal problems. Mix 2 tsp/ gallon of water and spray at transplant or when direct seeded crops are at 2-4 true leaf, then at 1-2 week intervals as required to control disease.",
      "Safely treat fungal problems with SERENADE Garden, a broad-spectrum bio-fungicide using Bacillus subtilis. Completely non-toxic to honey bees and beneficial insects.",

  "Tomato Leaf-Mold": {
    "Preventive Measures": [

    "Treatment Options": [
      "Treat with fungicidal sprays, covering all parts of the plant above ground, especially the underside of leaves. Calcium chloride sprays are recommended.",

  "Northern Corn Leaf Blight": {
    "Treatment Options": [
      "Control of this disease is often focused on management and prevention.",
      "First, choose corn varieties or hybrids that are resistant or at least have moderate resistance to northern corn leaf blight.",
      "When you grow corn, make sure it does not stay wet for long periods of time.",
      "The fungus that causes this infection needs between six and 18 hours of leaf wetness to develop.",
      "Plant corn with enough space for airflow and water in the morning so leaves can dry throughout the day.",
      "The fungus overwinters in plant material, so it is also important to manage infected plants.",
      "Tilling the corn into the soil is one strategy, but with a small garden it may make more sense to just remove and destroy the affected plants.",
      "Treating northern corn leaf blight involves using fungicides. For most home gardeners, this step isn’t needed, but if you have a bad infection, you may want to try this chemical treatment.",
      "The infection usually begins around the time of silking, and this is when the fungicide should be applied."

    "Preventive Measures": [
      "Choose corn varieties or hybrids that are resistant or have moderate resistance to northern corn leaf blight.",
      "Ensure that corn does not stay wet for long periods of time.",
      "Provide enough space for airflow when planting corn.",
      "Water corn in the morning to allow leaves to dry throughout the day.",
      "Manage and remove infected plants, especially during the overwintering period.",
      "Consider tilling infected corn into the soil for management.",
      "Apply fungicides preventively, especially around the time of silking."

    "Treatment Options": [
      "The application of fungicides can be beneficial when used on susceptible varieties.",
      "Apply a foliar fungicide early in the season if rust is bound to spread rapidly due to the weather conditions.",
      "Numerous fungicides are available for rust control. Products containing mancozeb, pyraclostrobin, pyraclostrobin + metconazole, pyraclostrobin + fluxapyroxad, azoxystrobin + propiconazole, trifloxystrobin + prothioconazole can be used to control the disease.",
      "An example of treatment could be: Spraying of mancozeb @ 2.5 g/l as soon as pustules appear and repeat at 10 days interval till flowering."
    ],
    "Preventive Measures": [
      "Plant resistant varieties available locally.",
      "Plant early to avoid optimal conditions for infection.",
      "Use shorter season varieties that mature earlier.",
      "Monitor your crop regularly for signs of the disease, even more so during overcast weather.",
      "Ensure balanced fertilization with split applications of nitrogen.",
      "Plan a crop rotation with non-susceptible crops."

  "Gray Leaf Spot on Corn:": {
    "Treatment Options": [
      "Disease management tactics include using resistant corn hybrids, conventional tillage where appropriate, and crop rotation.",
      "Foliar fungicides can be effective if economically warranted.",
      "Typically they are only profitable on susceptible inbreds or susceptible hybrids under a combination of high risk conditions with high yield potential, prolonged humid conditions, and evidence of disease development."
    ],
    "Preventive Measures": [
      "Choose corn hybrids that are resistant or have moderate resistance to Gray Leaf Spot.",
      "Rotate crops to disrupt the life cycle of the fungus and reduce the risk of infection in consecutive growing seasons.",
      "Implement appropriate tillage practices to manage residue and reduce the survival of the fungus in crop debris.",
      "Be vigilant in monitoring weather conditions, especially during periods of prolonged humidity, to assess the risk of disease development.",
      "Optimize plant spacing to allow for better air circulation, reducing humidity around the plants.",
      "Minimize wetting of foliage by avoiding overhead irrigation, which can create a conducive environment for fungal growth.",
      "Regularly scout for symptoms and take immediate action if Gray Leaf Spot is detected to prevent further spread.",
      "Maintain balanced nutrient levels, avoiding excessive nitrogen fertilization which can make plants more susceptible to diseases."
